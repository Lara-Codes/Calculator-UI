# Calculator-UI
This is a calculator user interface I wrote using Java.

You can run this in two ways: 

Download the code and navigate to the appropriate directory using Terminal or the command line. Run the driver file using: 
  javac Driver.java 
  java Driver 
  
Alternatively, you can download the jar file and double click to open. If the program doesn't work immediatley, navigate to the appropriate directory using Terminal or the command line. Run the jar file using: 
  java -jar Calculator.jar
